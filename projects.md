# University

## Machine Learning Coursework
- Python, Pandas, Sklearn
- Coursework for using KNN and Random Forest for the UCI Adult dataset for binary classification of income based off socio-economic factors.
- https://github.com/billy1479/AICoursework

## Networking Coursework
- Python
- This project is a Python-based client-server application that enables multiple users to send messages and transfer files over a network using sockets and threading. Users can authenticate, chat (direct or broadcast), and download files from a shared server folder, with all operations handled concurrently by a multi-threaded server.

## Programming Paradigms Coursework
- C++
- This C++ project implements lattice reduction using the LLL algorithm and searches for the shortest vector in a given lattice basis. It is designed for educational and experimental exploration of lattice algorithms and outputs the shortest vector's norm to a file.

## Reinforcement Learning
- Python
- This project implements a TD3 (Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) agent for the Bipedal Walker environment using the rldurham gym. It extends the original work by Jinghao and adapts it for both the standard ("softcore") and "hardcore" versions of the environment.

## Virtual Reality Coursework
- Python
- This project simulates a VR headset and multiple headsets interacting on a virtual floor, using real IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) data for realistic orientation and sensor fusion. The simulation is rendered in Python and produces video outputs demonstrating both pure gyroscope and sensor fusion tracking.

## Recommender Systems
- Python
- This is a **Recommender Systems Project** that builds two different game recommendation engines using Steam gaming data - a basic system (RS1) and an advanced system (RS2) that uses NLP techniques like sentiment analysis and Transformer models to enhance recommendations. The project processes Steam datasets including games, reviews, and user data, then applies machine learning to create personalized game suggestions through interactive user interfaces. It also includes evaluation tools to compare the performance of both recommendation approaches, requiring several hours of preprocessing to generate enhanced data files with sentiment scores and improved game metadata.

## Cryptography
- Python
- This is a **Cryptography Coursework** that implements fundamental cryptographic algorithms based on the discrete logarithm problem, including Diffie-Hellman key exchange, ElGamal encryption/decryption, and various discrete logarithm solvers (Pohlig-Hellman, Shanks, Pollard's Rho, Miller-Rabin). The project provides both secure cryptographic operations and cryptanalysis tools that can attack these same systems by solving discrete logarithm problems. It's designed for educational purposes with a simple Python implementation that requires no external dependencies, allowing users to experiment with public-key cryptography concepts and understand both the security mechanisms and their potential vulnerabilities.

## Deep-Learning
- Python
- This is a **Deep Learning project** that implements both generative and discriminative models using PyTorch, featuring a Conditional GAN for generating CIFAR-100 images and a CNN-based classifier for multi-class image classification on a 20-class dataset. The project includes comprehensive evaluation metrics like FID scores and LPIPS for the generative model, plus hyperparameter optimization through grid search for the discriminative classifier. Both components are implemented as Jupyter notebooks with complete training pipelines, evaluation tools, and visualization capabilities for analyzing model performance and generated outputs.

# IBM

## IBM Skills Build AR Application
- C#, Unity, Google Firebase
- Developed a VR application for the IBM Skills Build with a small team of developers. App was designed for mobile devices, where users would scan an AR icon and would then be redirected to the IBM Skills Build webiste. Users could sign-up, favourite courses and rate other users recommended courses. Data was modelled using Google Firebase. 

# MoveIn

## MoveIn - Student House-finding App
- Flutter, Google Firebase, Azure
- Developed a flutter mobile application to help students find housemates. Worked on a small developer team at University with the hope of launching the app on the app store. Users could create accounts, stored in Firebase, and create virtual houses where other users could join in the hope of finding housemates. App has chat functionality and allowed for upload of images which were stored on Azure.
